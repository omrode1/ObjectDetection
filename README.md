Introduction
Object Detection with OpenVINO is an open-source project that utilizes the Intel Distribution of OpenVINO toolkit to enable real-time object detection on various hardware platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and Intel's Neural Compute Stick. The project simplifies the deployment and optimization of deep learning models for object detection tasks, making it easier for developers and researchers to integrate this functionality into their applications.

Key Features
Easy Integration: Simplified interface for integrating pre-trained or custom-trained object detection models using OpenVINO.
Cross-platform Compatibility: Support for CPUs, GPUs, and Intel Neural Compute Stick, ensuring portability across diverse hardware configurations.
Real-time Performance: Accelerated deep learning inference for real-time object detection with reduced inference times.
Customization and Flexibility: Ability to fine-tune and adapt models for specific use cases and datasets.
Community-driven Development: Active community fostering collaboration, contributions, and continuous improvement.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Object_detection_openVino.git
cd Object_detection_openVino
Set up the OpenVINO toolkit on your system. Refer to Intel's OpenVINO Documentation for installation instructions.

Install the required Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Download or prepare the object detection model of your choice and convert it to OpenVINO IR format using the Model Optimizer tool provided by OpenVINO.

Update the configuration file (config.json) with the paths to the model IR files, input and output configurations, and other relevant parameters.

Run the object detection script:

bash
Copy code
python object_detection.py --config config.json
Watch as the script performs real-time object detection on the video stream from your webcam or a video file!
